h1. About vmath

vmath is a simple linear algebra library written in go and designed solely for 3D graphics.  It defines structs for points, vectors, and small matrices.

The name of the go package is simply *vmath*.  The git repository is *govmath*.

h1. The structs

vmath defines 6 structs, each of which has a tiny two-character name.

3x1 | V3 | Vector in R3 |
4x1 | V4 | Homogeneous vector |
3x1 | P3 | Point in R3, similar to a V4 with w=1 |
3x3 | M3 | Can represent rotation and scale |
4x3 | T3 | Affine transform; adds translation to M3 |
4x4 | M4 | Homogeneous transform (suitable for perpective projection) |

h1. Examples

Not that vectors and points are distinct concepts.  For example, a V3 can be added to a P3 to yield another P3:

<code>
v := vmath.V3New(0, 0, 1)
p := vmath.P3New(1, 0, 0)
var p2 vmath.P3 = v.AddP3(p)
</code>

Adding a V3 to another V3 yields a V3:

<code>
v1 := vmath.V3New(0, 0, 1)
v2 := vmath.V3New(1, 0, 0)
var v vmath.V3 = v.AddV3(p)
</code>

All functions are prefixed with the type they return (*V3New*), while all methods are postfixed with the type they take (*AddP3*).

<code>
var ᴨ float32 = float32(math.Atan(1) * 4)
var ε float32 = 1e-4
Β := M4Translation(1, 0, 0)
</code>
